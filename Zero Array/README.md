You are given an array 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛.

In one operation you can choose two elements 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑎𝑗 (𝑖≠𝑗) and decrease each of them by one.

You need to check whether it is possible to make all the elements equal to zero or not.

### Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤105) — the size of the array.

The second line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤109) — the elements of the array.

### Output
Print "YES" if it is possible to make all elements zero, otherwise print "NO".
